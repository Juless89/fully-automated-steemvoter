## About

The fully automated STEEM voter will automatically upvote authors on the STEEM Blockchain. For each user the upvote weight, the amount of upvotes per day and a delay can be set. This is an open source project contributed to [Utopian](https://join.utopian.io/). And is live at [SteemAutomated](https://steemautomated.eu/)

## Standalone voter
The standalone server can be used to perform simple voting for 1 account.

## Server voter
The server voter is the backend application used to perform all voting being done at [SteemAutomated](https://steemautomated.eu/). The website offers a easy to user interface for users to interact with, add and update their voting rules. User authentication is done by Steemconnect.
